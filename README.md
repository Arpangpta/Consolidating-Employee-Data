# Consolidating_Employee_Data

This is a project for `**Data Preparation**` in which the data is obtained from multiple sources such as from different types of files.
Then the data is loaded and combined using **Join** as well as **Merge** DataFrame functions.

Learning Outcome:
1) How to load data from different types of files with the argument details. 
2) How to consider primitive key of the Dataframe as Index of the DataFrame through the means of Indexing and Unindexing.
3) Joining loaded Dataframes using Join as well as Merge Functions. Furthermore, using those Dataframes to join to others. 
4) Accessing the values of the Dataframe and modifying them.
5) Setting index of final Dataframe by accessing the headers of it rather than giving a hard value input.
